### About this Specialization

Take your first step towards a career in software development with this introduction to Javaâ€”one of the most in-demand programming languages and the foundation of the Android operating system. Designed for beginners, this Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs.

### Applied Learning Project


Centered around projects, this Specialization will help you create a portfolio of work to demonstrate your new programming skills. In the capstone you will create a recommender engine similar to those used by Netflix or Amazon. Additional projects in your portfolio will include:an interactive webpage that applies filters to images, an analysis of CSV data files, an encryption program, and a predictive text generator.
