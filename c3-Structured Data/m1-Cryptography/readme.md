## Cryptography: Keeping Information Secret Module

In this module, you will learn about the basics of cryptography, the science of keeping information private and secure. You will learn about simpler cryptographic systems, which were used from the Roman Empire through the early 1900s. You will learn how to implement these ciphers, as well as how to break them. To solve these problems, you will work more with processing Strings, but also learn about arrays—a way to store an indexable sequence of elements. 

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Combine Strings using concatenation; 

- Build Strings within a Java program using StringBuilder;

- Use arrays to store and manipulate collections of data; 

- Refactor your programs for improved organization using object-oriented principles; and

Practice effective algorithm design.
